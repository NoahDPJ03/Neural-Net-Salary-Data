If we know what kind of job a person has, their education level, age / experience, we most likely can get a good guess of the amount of money they make.
What I create here is a computerized neural network that best guesses a person's salary, just as us humans can do, and then sees how accurate it gets (~80% r^2 score). 
Before I do this, I have to incorporate data cleaning strategies and I also do some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which gives us a better understanding of the data.
