If we know a lot of factors about a person and the job they have, their education level, and what they do, we most likely can get a good guess of the amount of money they make.
What I create here is a computer neural network that best guesses a person's salary, just as us humans can do, and then see how accurate it gets (~80% r^2 score). Before I do this, I have 
to incorporate data cleaning strategies and I also do some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which gives us a better understanding of the data.
